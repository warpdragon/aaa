# Moar-Docs
The goal of the Moar-docs branch is to compile EVERYONES information into one spot where I (and others) can view, edit, and finally merge everything into the final project. We are interested in "official" information directly related to the development, release, and support of the AAA project. Think of it this branch as a Library, ensuring that everyone has easy access to the most current information available. To that end, those who contribute are also asked to seek out and make contacts on the various teams, and work with key members to ensure that notes are taken and reported to Moar-docs whenever ideas or designs become "official".
## So what does "Official" mean?
There's a lot of ideas floating around. But most aren't official. If you're not sure whether something is official, first check /docs. If the document is not there, click "Search" in discord to see if a similar question has already been asked. If you're positive it has not been asked & answered, and assuming you've followed each of the preceding steps thoroughly, the next step is to ask in the appropriate help channel with "@<username>" to a Core Member in the Discord.
## Things you can contribute
Artists can write up documentation on creating and baking textures, creating models, etc. Anything any team feels would be necessary to publish in case new members need a reference to start working quickly and effectively. Musicians can write up documentation on putting music into the game, Balance can publish their workflow, Design can publish the official design philosophies so they can stop repeating themselves every 10 seconds. You get the idea!
